Hey! We could use an extra hand taking a look at this new strain of ranswomare that is emerging. It seems like it's very much in the development stage still (fortunately), but they've got a nifty way to hide the malware's real payload from automated static analysis.

Can you take a look at this sample and see if you can reverse engineer it?
