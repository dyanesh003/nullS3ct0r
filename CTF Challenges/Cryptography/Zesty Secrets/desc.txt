Description: Rumor has it that nullS3ct0r accidentally scrambled a sensitive message with a mysterious encryption that’s as tangy as freshly squeezed citrus. Some say it looks like a classic substitution cipher hidden under base X, but could that just be a red herring? Is it just a jumble of alphanumerics, or something far more complex? The key is somewhere in the mix—maybe it’s just a small typo, or maybe there’s more to the puzzle than meets the eye.
