The admin believes the application is secure because passwords are stored using the MD5 hashing algorithm. However, there's a critical mistake in the way the application handles authentication. Can you login as admin?

Default Username: "user"
Default Password: "user"

Hint: Sometimes, even strong-looking hashes can be tricked by weak comparisons!

Note: No bruteforce is necessary on the application
